# Healthcare-Web-Project

We are a web development company working with a 
healthcare client looking to connect patients directly 
with their doctors. We need someone to be able to take 
PSD mockup files from our designer and convert them 
into custom code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We 
have not decided on which JavaScript library to use, but 
will be open to working with the one youâ€™re most familiar 
with. We have the designs for 10 pages and will need 
them to be completed in 3 months. We are open to 
working with all levels of experience, but the pay will be 
adjusted based on your experience.
